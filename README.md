## Project Files

### 1. `data.py`
This module handles data loading and preprocessing.

#### Key Functions:
- **Loading Data**:
  - Reads sales data from CSV files within the `data/` folder.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handles missing values, data type conversions, and formatting.
- **Merging Datasets**:
  - Combines monthly files into a single comprehensive dataset.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

def load_data(file_path):
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
    return data
```

### 2. `SalesAnalysis.py`
This is the core analytics module that processes and visualizes data.

#### Key Functions:
- **Sales Trends Analysis**:
  - Identifies revenue patterns over time.
- **Product Performance**:
  - Ranks top-performing products by sales.
- **Seasonality Insights**:
  - Analyzes how sales vary across months and seasons.
- **Visualization**:
  - Generates bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.

#### Example Code:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_monthly_sales(data):
    monthly_sales = data.groupby(data['Date'].dt.month)['Revenue'].sum()
    monthly_sales.plot(kind='bar')
    plt.title('Monthly Sales Revenue')
    plt.show()
```

## `Sales_Data/`
The `Sales_data/` folder contains monthly sales files in CSV format. Each file includes:
- **Date**: Date of the transaction.
- **Product**: Name of the product sold.
- **Quantity**: Units sold.
- **Revenue**: Total sales revenue for the product.

Ensure that all sales data files are placed in this folder before running the analysis.

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Organize Data
Place all sales data files in the `data/` folder.

### Step 3: Run the Analysis
Execute the analysis script:
```bash
python SalesAnalysis.py
```
